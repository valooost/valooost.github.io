<h1>How we use VR in lesson</h1>
<h2>Tested in the Ohm High School, Erlangen. 

We, the new Media work group, are happy to present our newest milestone in using VR in lessons:
The first usage.
With the allowity of a geography prof, Mr. Spies, we used Vive VR Glasses in his lesson. In thanks to Steam VR/Google Earth VR, we were able to show students the earth in VR mode.</h2>
